Optical Character Recognition is the conversion of a non-editable text (printed PDF for example)  into  a  computer  file,  which  can  then  be  saved  and  edited.This  project  can  be  sliced  into  two  big  part.   Images  correcting  and other operations on the picture, followed by the character recognition using a neural network.  The goal of this project is to be able to code an algorithm in C (specially in the C99 norm) to which we add a GUI(Graphical User Interface) to ease the use of the program.  This project is made during the second year of preparatory class at Epita.
